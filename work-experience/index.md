### _Q3 2022 - Q2 2023_

### Flutter Developer - Jimdo (as Netlight Consultant)

The project was to create a banking app that the client's customers could use as
business bank accounts. I joined as it had been ongoing for a couple of months.

In addition to writing clean, scalable and well-tested flutter code I took care
of the things we had to do natively on both Android and iOS, which were
primarily related to biometrics and cryptography. I also managed our github
action jobs and did some backend development in Go.

My greatest accomplishments include massively simplifying and improving the
architecture of our onboarding, analyzing and revamping the entire error
handling, introducing integration tests to the code base, and taking
responsibility of onboarding a new team member and quickly getting him
productive and well-integrated into the team.

### _Q3 2021 - Q3 20223_

### Android Developer - TIER Mobility (as Netlight Consultant)

At the time Tier was a fast growing start up in the mobility industry and one of
the strongest players on the European micro-mobility market.

As an Android developer at TIER I was part of several different teams to help
develop the in-app shop, loyalty program, group ride feature and pricing
experiments.

My greatest accomplishments include reaching feature parity with the iOS app in
each team I joined, delivering the group ride feature from ideation to MVP on
time, and spearheading the introduction of Android Compose to the code base.

### _Q4 2019 - Q3 2021_

### Android Developer - Jochen Schweizer My Days (as Netlight Consultant)

At the time Jochen Schweizer Mydays Group was the market leader of experience
products in Germany. The company sold around 1 million vouchers and tickets per
year for all types of experiences.

I played a vital part in a small Android team in revamping the legacy app to a
state of the art application written entirely in Kotlin and using MVI as an
architectural pattern. We used the newest technologies and tools such as Room as
a local database, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, coroutines for
threading, LiveData and Flow for reactive state management, and the Android
navigation component for navigation. After a few months we also rewrote the
entire UI of the app using Android Compose.

My main accomplishments were being part of rewriting the entire UI using Android
Compose and maintaining a crash-free rate of >99 % thanks to great software
architecture and testing.

### _Q2 2019 - Q4 2019_

### Java Developer - Itello (as Meepo Consultant)

At the time Itello was the leading provider of insurance management systems in
the Nordics. Their systems needed to reliably and securely handle an enormous
amount of insurances and transactions each day.

I worked as a Java developer in one of the Scrum teams. I learnt a lot from
working in a large organization with a rigurous software development
methodology. I became a much better software developer in general and Java
developer in particular.

### _Q3 2018 - Q2 2019_

### Flutter developer - The Life You Can Save (as Meepo Consultant Inhouse)

The Life You Can Save is a non-profit organization that analyzes charities and
promotes the most effective charities in the world.

The goal of the project was to develop an app for The Life You Can Save through
which users could donate to effective charities. As one of two lead developers I
was part of building the app from scratch until the initial release a couple of
months later.

At the start of the project I was part of deciding the system architecture and
setting up the CI/CD pipelines using Fastlane and Jenkins. After that most of my
time was spent on developing the app in flutter and creating cloud functions in
Firebase. I also performed a lot of other tasks, such as being part of customer
meetings and planning and doing user testing.

My greatest accomplishments include setting up the system architecture, bringing
the app from ideation to MVP release and managing stakeholders.
