        <h2>Java Developer - Meepo / Itello, Q2 2019 - Q4 2019</h2>

          enormous amount of insurances and transactions each day.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked as a Java developer in one of the Scrum teams. I learned what
          it's like to work in a large organization using Scrum. I became a much
          better software develop in general and Java developer in particular.

        <h2>
          Flutter developer - Meepo / The Life You Can Save, Q3 2018 - Q2 2019
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Life You Can Save is a non-profit organization which analyzes
          charities and promotes the most effective charities in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          As one of two lead developers I was part of building the app from the
          idea phase to the initial release a couple of months later. Because of
          the start-up-like atmosphere of the project I did a lot of different
          tasks. Apart from flutter development I helped to set up the system
          architecture and the CI/CD pipelines, create cloud functions, and I
          was also part of customer meetings and user testing.
        </p>
