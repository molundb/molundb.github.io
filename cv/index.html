  <h2>Java Developer - Meepo / Itello, Q2 2019 - Q4 2019</h2>
  <p>
    Itello is the leading provider of insurance management systems in the
    Nordics. Their systems need to reliably and securely handle an enormous
    amount of insurances and transactions each day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked as a Java developer in one of the Scrum teams. I learned what it's
    like to work in a large organization with a rigurous software development
    methodology. I became a much better software developer in general and Java
    developer in particular.

  <h2>
    Flutter developer - Meepo / The Life You Can Save, Q3 2018 - Q2 2019
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Life You Can Save is a non-profit organization which analyzes charities
    and promotes the most effective charities in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    As one of two lead developers I was part of building the app from scratch to
    a release a couple of months later. At the start of the project I was part
    of deciding the system architecture and setting up the CI/CD pipelines using
    Fastlane and Jenkins. After that most of my time was spent on flutter
    development and creating cloud functions in Firebase. However, because of
    the start-up-like atmosphere of the project, I also performed a lot of other
    tasks, such as being part of customer meetings and planning and executing
    user testing.
