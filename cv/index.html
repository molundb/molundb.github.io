    I played a vital part in a small Android team in revamping the app from a
    state of emergency to a state of the art application written entirely in
    Kotlin and using MVI as an architectural pattern and the newest technologies
    and tools such as Room as a local database, Dagger Hilt for dependency
    injection, coroutines for threading, LiveData and Flow for reactive state
    management, and the Android navigation component for navigation. More
    recently we rewrote the entire UI of the app using Android Compose.

    Itello is the leading provider of insurance management systems in the
    Nordics. Their systems need to reliably and securely handle an enormous
    amount of insurances and transactions each day.

  <p>
    I worked as a Java developer in one of the Scrum teams. I learned what it's
    like to work in a large organization with a rigurous software development
    methodology. I became a much better software developer in general and Java
    developer in particular.

  <h2>Q3 2018 - Q2 2019</h2>
  <h2 class="role-and-company">
    Flutter developer - Meepo / The Life You Can Save
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Life You Can Save is a non-profit organization which analyzes charities
    and promotes the most effective charities in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    As one of two lead developers I was part of building the app from scratch to
    a release a couple of months later. At the start of the project I was part
    of deciding the system architecture and setting up the CI/CD pipelines using
    Fastlane and Jenkins. After that most of my time was spent on flutter
    development and creating cloud functions in Firebase. I also performed a lot
    of other tasks, such as being part of customer meetings and planning and
    doing user testing.
