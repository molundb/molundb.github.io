          I worked as a Java developer in one of the Scrum teams. I learned what

        <p>
          I was a major part of building the app all the way from the idea phase
          to the initial release months later. As the main thing I did was
          developing the app, I learnt tons about Flutter development and Dart,
          but I was also learnt a lot from setting up the system architecture,
          setting up the CI/CD pipelines, creating cloud functions, being part
          of customer meetings and doing user testing.
        </p>
