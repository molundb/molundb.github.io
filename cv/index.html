          I am the lead developer of the team developing Jochen Schweizer's
          Android app. By working closely together with the IOS team, the
          designers and the backend team we have met all our deadlines while
          doing a complete rework of the core functionality of the app.

        <h2>Java Developer - Meepo / Itello, Q2 2019 - Q4 2019</h2>
        <p>
          Itello is the leading provider for insurance management systems in the
          Nordics. Their systems need to reliably and securely handle an
          enormous amount of insurances and transactions each day.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked as a Java developer in one of the Scrum teams. I learned what
          it's like to work in a large organization with a rigurous software
          development methodology. I became a much better software developer in
          general and Java developer in particular.

        <h2>
          Flutter developer - Meepo / The Life You Can Save, Q3 2018 - Q2 2019
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Life You Can Save is a non-profit organization which analyzes
          charities and promotes the most effective charities in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          As one of two lead developers I was part of building the app from
          scratch to the initial release a couple of months later. At the start
          of the project I was part of deciding the system architecture and
          setting up the CI/CD pipelines using Fastlane and Jenkins. After that
          most of my time was spent on flutter development and creating cloud
          functions in Firebase. However, because of the start-up-like
          atmosphere of the project, I also performed a lot of other tasks, such
          as being part of customer meetings and planning and executing user
          testing.
        </p>
