    Senior Android Developer - Zooplus (as Netlight Consultant)
  </h3>

  <p>
    Zooplus is a an online reilater of pet food and supplies, with a yearly
    revenue of more than â‚¬2.1 billion. I am part of a Scrum team developing the
    Zooplus Android app.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my first three months I have rapidly integrated into the team, becoming a
    major contributor to the Android app. I've played a crucial role in meeting
    the deadline for a significant new feature and have continually enhanced the
    codebase during feature implementation. Additionally, I initiated
    discussions and planning for essential architectural improvements while
    making valuable contributions to our team's Scrum process.

    Flutter Developer - Jimdo (as Netlight Consultant)
  </h3>

  <p>
    The project was to create a banking app that the client's customers could
    use as business bank accounts. I joined as it had been ongoing for a couple
    of months.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to writing clean, scalable and well-tested flutter code I took
    care of the things we had to do natively on both Android and iOS, which were
    primarily related to biometrics and cryptography. I also managed our github
    action jobs and did some backend development in Go.
  </p>

  <p>
    My greatest accomplishments include massively simplifying and improving the
    architecture of our onboarding, analyzing and revamping the entire error
    handling, introducing integration tests to the code base, and taking
    responsibility of onboarding a new team member and quickly getting him
    productive and well-integrated into the team.

    Android Developer - TIER Mobility (as Netlight Consultant)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Tier is a fast growing start up in the mobility industry and one of the
    strongest players on the European micro-mobility market.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an Android developer at TIER I was part of several different teams to
    help develop the in-app shop, loyalty program, group ride feature and
    pricing experiments.
  </p>

  <p>
    My greatest accomplishments include reaching feature parity with the iOS app
    in each team I joined, delivering the group ride feature from ideation to
    MVP on time, and spearheading the introduction of Android Compose to the
    code base.

    Android Developer - Jochen Schweizer My Days (as Netlight Consultant)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Jochen Schweizer Mydays Group is the market leader of experience products in
    Germany. The company sells around 1 million vouchers and tickets per year
    for all types of experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    I played a vital part in a small Android team in revamping the legacy app to
    a state of the art application written entirely in Kotlin and using MVI as
    an architectural pattern. We used the newest technologies and tools such as
    Room as a local database, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, coroutines
    for threading, LiveData and Flow for reactive state management, and the
    Android navigation component for navigation. After a few months we also
    rewrote the entire UI of the app using Android Compose.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main accomplishments were being part of rewriting the entire UI using
    Android Compose and maintaining a crash-free rate of >99 % thanks to great
    software architecture and testing.

    At the time Itello was the leading provider of insurance management systems
    in the Nordics. Their systems needed to reliably and securely handle an
    enormous amount of insurances and transactions each day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked as a Java developer in one of the Scrum teams. I learnt a lot from
    working in a large organization with a rigurous software development
    methodology. I became a much better software developer in general and Java
    developer in particular.

  </h3>
  <p>
    The Life You Can Save is a non-profit organization that analyzes charities
    and promotes the most effective charities in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of the project was to develop an app for The Life You Can Save
    through which users could donate to effective charities. As one of two lead
    developers I was part of building the app from scratch until the initial
    release a couple of months later.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the start of the project I was part of deciding the system architecture
    and setting up the CI/CD pipelines using Fastlane and Jenkins. After that
    most of my time was spent on developing the app in flutter and creating
    cloud functions in Firebase. I also performed a lot of other tasks, such as
    being part of customer meetings and planning and doing user testing.
  </p>

  <p>
    My greatest accomplishments include setting up the system architecture,
    bringing the app from ideation to MVP release and managing stakeholders.
