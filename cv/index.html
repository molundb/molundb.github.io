        <h2>Java Developer - Meepo / Itello, Q2 2019 - Q4 2019</h2>
        <p>
          Itello is the leading provider for insurance management systems in the
          Nordics. Their systems need to reliably and securely handle an
          enormous amount of insurances and transactions each day.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked as a Java developer at Itello in one of their Scrum teams. I
          learned what it's like to work in a large organization using Scrum. I
          became a much better Java developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was a major part of building the app all the way from the idea phase
          to the initial release months later. As the main thing I did was
          developing the app, I learnt tons about Flutter development and Dart,
          but I was also learnt a lot from setting up the system architecture,
          setting up the CI/CD pipelines, creating cloud functions, being part
          of customer meetings and doing user testing.
