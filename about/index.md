# About Me

### _Biography_

I am a software engineer from Sweden. I was born and raised in Sweden but
love traveling and living abroad. Apart from Sweden I've lived in Ireland,
China and Germany. I've got a double master's degree in computer science and
have been working full-time as a software engineer since 2023. I'm
specialized in mobile development, specifically Android and Flutter, but I
love learning and enjoy all types of software development. My goal is to use
my skills in software development to make the world a better place.

### _Interests_

I enjoy working on hobby projects like Mellotippet. I am very interested in
what it means to live a good life. I enjoy learning languages and speak
Swedish, English, German and basic Spanish and French. I like chess and won
the [Swedish Chess Championship](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM_i_schack)
for kids in 2007 when I was 13 years old. I love music and to play the
guitar. I have been vegan since June 2016 and write [reviews](https://www.happycow.net/members/profile/Dandido) for restaurants that I visit. I consider myself an effective altruist and one of
my main goals in life is making the world a better place. In 2018, I took
the [Giving What We Can Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge), and have since been [donating](/donations/) 10 % of my salary to the most [effective charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/choosing-a-charity) in the world.
