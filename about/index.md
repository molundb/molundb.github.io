# About Me

### _Biography_

I'm a software engineer passionate about using technology to create positive
change. I was born and raised in Sweden but have had the privilege of also
calling Ireland, China, Germany, and Colombia home, embracing diverse cultures, languages
and experiences along the way. I have a master's degree in Computer Science and
am specialized in Android and Flutter development.

### _Interests_

In my free time, I like learning and trying new things. Here are some of my
interests:

- Language learning; I am fluent in Swedish, English, and German, decent in Spanish, and learning Italian
- Visiting and [reviewing](https://www.happycow.net/members/profile/Dandido) vegan restaurants
- Lifting weights and getting sweaty at my local Crossfit box
- Exploring philosophy, politics, and ethics
- Effective altruism; I took the
  [Giving What We Can pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge) in 2018
  and consistently donate 10% of my salary to impactful charities. Learn more
  about my [donations](/donations/).

I'm always excited about new challenges and opportunities to collaborate on
projects that make a difference. Feel free to contact me on
