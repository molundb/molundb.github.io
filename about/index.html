  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h3 class="italic">Biography</h3>
  <p>
    I was born in Sweden in 1994 and raised in the small city of Borlänge. When
    I was 18 years old I moved to Linköping to study Computer Engineering at
    Linköping Technical University. In the Spring of 2017 I spent a semester
    abroad at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. I graduated in 2018 with
    a double master's degree from Linköping Technical University and Harbin
    Institute of Technology. After my studies I moved to Stockholm to work at
    Meepo, a small app-studio. At Meepo I <a href="/cv/">developed</a> a Flutter
    app for the charity organization
    <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a>. In
    December 2019 I moved to Munich, Germany to start working at Netlight
    Consulting, a Swedish IT-consulting company. In March 2021 I made a transfer
    to Netlight's Berlin office, and that's where I've been living ever since.

    I am very interested in what it means to live a good life. Stoicism is the
    life philosophy I resonate with most. My aspiration is to live an exciting,
    entertaining and fullfilling life while causing as little suffering as
    possible. I enjoy learning languages and speak Swedish, English, German and
    basic Spanish and French. I like chess and won the

    guitar. I have been vegan since June 2016 and write

    restaurants that I visit. I consider myself an effective altruist and one of
