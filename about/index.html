        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Sweden in 1994 and raised in the small city of Borlänge.
          When I was 18 years old I moved to Linköping to
          study Computer Engineering at Linköping Technical University. In the
          Spring of 2017 I spent a semester abroad studying at Harbin Institute
          of Technology in Harbin, China. I wrote my master's thesis during the
          Spring of 2018. It was about adding gamification elements to an
          education app for children with learning disabilities, in order to increase
          their motivation to use the app. I graduated in 2018 with a double
          master's degree from Linköping Technical University and Harbin
          Institute of Technology. Immediately after my studies I moved to Stockholm
          to start working at Meepo, a small app-studio. At Meepo I developed a
          Flutter app for the charity organization The Life You Can Save. In
          December 2019 I moved to Munich to start working at Netlight
          Consulting, a Swedish IT-consulting company. In March 2021 I made a transfer to Netlight's Berlin office.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="hobbies">
          I enjoy app development, which is what I do for a living. My main goal in life, however, 
          is making the world a better place. I
          want to inspire people by living an exciting, entertaining and
          fullfilling life while causing as little suffering to the planet,
          other humans and animals as possible. I have been vegan since June 2016 and like writing <a href="https://www.happycow.net/members/profile/Dandido">reviews</a> for restaurants that I visit. I
          consider myself an effective altruist and have <a href="/donations/">donated</a> 10 % of my salary to the
          most effective charities in the world since August 2018.
