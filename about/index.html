        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Sweden in 1994 and raised in the small city of Borlänge
          where I lived until I was 18 years old, when I moved to Linköping to
          study Computer Engineering at Linköping Technical University. In the
          Spring of 2017 I spent a semester abroad studying at Harbin Institute
          of Technology in Harbin, China. I wrote my master's thesis during the
          Spring of 2018. It was about adding gamification elements to an
          education app for children with learning disabilities to increase
          their motivation. I graduated in 2018 with a double master's degree
          from Linköping Technical University and Harbin Institute of
          Technology. Right after my studies I moved to Stockholm to start
          working at Meepo, a small app-studio. At Meepo I developed a Flutter
          app for the charity organization The Life You Can Save. In December
          2019 I moved to Munich to start working at Netlight, a Swedish
          IT-consulting company.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I like mobile development, which is what I do for a living. I want to
          combine my love for technology with making the world a better place. I
          want to inspire people by living an exciting, entertaining and
          fullfilling life while causing as little suffering to the planet,
          other humans and animals as possible. I care a lot about the
          environment and haven't flown since February 2018. I've been vegan
          since June 2016. I am an effective altruist and have donated 10 % of
          my salary to the most effective charities in the world since August
          2018.
