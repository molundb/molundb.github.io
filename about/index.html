        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I was born in Sweden in 1994. I was raised in the small city of
          Borlänge until I was 18 years old when I moved to Linköping to study
          Computer Engineering at Linköping Technical University. Towards the
          end of my student years I grew interested in entrepreneurship and
          mobile development. In Spring 2017 I spent a semester abroad studying
          at Harbin Institute of Technology in Harbin, China. I wrote my
          master's thesis during the Spring of 2018. It was about adding
          gamification elements to an education app for children with learning
          disabilities to increase their motivation. I graduated in 2018 with a
          double master's degree from Linköping Technical University and Harbin
          Institute of Technicology. After that I moved to Stockholm to start
          working at Meepo AB, a small app-studio. In 2016 I went vegan. In
          December 2019 I moved to Munich. I want to combine my love for
          technology with making the world a better place.
