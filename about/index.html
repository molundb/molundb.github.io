  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in Sweden in 1994 and raised in the small city of Borlänge. When
    I was 18 years old I moved to Linköping to study Computer Engineering at
    Linköping Technical University. In the Spring of 2017 I spent a semester
    abroad at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. I graduated in 2018 with
    a double master's degree from Linköping Technical University and Harbin
    Institute of Technology. After my studies I moved to Stockholm to work at
    Meepo, a small app-studio. At Meepo I <a href="/cv/">developed</a> a Flutter
    app for the charity organization
    <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a>. In
    December 2019 I moved to Munich, Germany to start working at Netlight
    Consulting, a Swedish IT-consulting company. In March 2021 I made a transfer
    to Netlight's Berlin office, and that's where I've been living ever since.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p class="hobbies">
    I enjoy app development, which is what I do for a living. One of my main
    goals in life, however, is making the world a better place. I am very
    interested in what it means to live a good life. The philosophy of life I
    identify the most with is stoicism. I love music, dancing and going to
    clubs, concerts, music festivals. I like learning languages and speak German
    on a C1 level. I want to inspire people by living an exciting, entertaining
    and fullfilling life while causing as little suffering to the planet, other
    humans and animals as possible. I have been vegan since June 2016 and like
    writing
    <a href="https://www.happycow.net/members/profile/Dandido">reviews</a> for
    restaurants that I visit. I consider myself an effective altruist and have
    <a href="/donations/">donated</a> 10 % of my salary to the most effective
    charities in the world since August 2018.
