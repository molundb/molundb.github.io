# Donations

Thanks to resources like
[How Rich Am I](https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i) I've
calculated that I'm part of the world's richest 1% before donating 10 % of my
income, and the richest 1.1% after donating 10% of my income. When combined with
the substantial impact that donating to effective charities can achieve (as
demonstrated by resources like
[The Life You Can Save's Impact Calculator](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/impact-calculator/)),
I believe it becomes a moral responsibility for individuals in my position to
contribute a significant portion of their income. In August 2018, I took the
[Giving What We Can Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) to donate 10% of
my post-tax income.

With this page, my aim is to inspire and encourage others to donate effectively.
I strongly believe that if everyone were to allocate 10% of their income to
impactful charities, the world would be unimaginably
[much better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtWINl3C_7s&ab_channel=TEDxTalks).
