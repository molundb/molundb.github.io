  <p>
  I've <a href="https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i">calculated</a> that I am part of the richest 1 % of the world population before donating 10 % of my income, and part of the richest 1,1 % after donating 10 %. 
  Combining that with the fact of how much good donating to effective charities <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/impact-calculator/" >can do</a>, I find it makes it a moral obligation for me to donate some, non-negligible part of my income.
  In August 2018 I therefore took the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can Pledge</a> to donate 10 % of my post-tax income.

  <br></br>
  With this page I want to inspire others to also donate money effectively. 
  The world would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtWINl3C_7s&ab_channel=TEDxTalks">unimaginably much better</a> if everyone donated 10 % of their income to effective charities.
