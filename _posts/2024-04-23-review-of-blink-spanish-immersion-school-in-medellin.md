## Background

One of the biggest reasons why I moved to Medellin was to learn Spanish. Therefore I had done some research in advance for language schools. The one I found the best was Blink. I spent three weeks at Blink. I'd never done anything similar when learning a language and I was curious to see how much I could improve in three weeks.

Blink is a language school located in El Poblado, the most touristy neighbourhood of Medell√≠n. Being an immersive school it offers accommodation and meals in addition to Spanish, but because I already had a place to stay and like to cook my own food I only got the Spanish classes. They offer several different packages and I decided to buy three weeks of the BLINK UNLIMITED package.

As you can see there are three different kind of classes: group classes, private classes and master classes.

### Group classes
The bulk of your learning. The group classes usually start between 8-9 am and lasts for four hours plus a fifteen minute break. The groups consist of 2-6 students and it's the same group teacher for one week. There are fifteen different difficulty levels and to decide which group you should be in you take a placement test a few days before the first day. The levels are something like this:

A1.1
A1.2
A1.3
A2.1
A2.2
A2.3
B1.1
B1.2

I got placed in A1.3++/A2.1 for my first week.

### Private classes
A class with just you and a teacher. It can be the same teacher as your group teacher or a different one. In my private classes the teacher asked what I wanted to do and sometimes had exercises and games prepared. Apart from some specific questions I mostly just talked with my teacher during the private lessons.

### Master classes
Different one hour classes focused on one specific topic. The topics range from reflexive verbs, pronunciation, the past tenses, or the subjunctive and there were 35+ weekly master classes to choose from. Importantly, there were the same master classes each week, which is why I switched to more private classes instead for my third week.


## The Good
One of the things I liked the most about my time at blink were all the activies and getting to know the other students. I danced salsa, played tejo, went to football, and ton of language exchanges. Most students were in their twenties and from Europe, the United States or Canada. About 60 % were girls. Almost everyone was on a long trip either around the world or through South America. A few people were on a shorter trip to Colombia and maybe some other country. I didn't meet anyone else who was planning to stay longer like me.

My favorite teachers were Danny and Daniel Gaitan and for the third week I asked for Dani and managed to get her as my private teacher which was great.


## The Bad
I didn't eat the food or stay at Blink so I can't really comment on it, but I can say that I talked to a lot of people who got pretty bored of rice and beans after two weeks. Some people also moved out of the hostel after a few days.


## The Ugly
My last lesson at Blink was a one hour private class with a teacher I hadn't had before. She told me some things that I think it's fair to share.

My level the first week was A1.3++/A2.1, the second week it was A2.2 and the third week it was A2.3.

The rate at which students progress throughout the levels is ridiculous and unrealistic. 

The levels are
