## Background

Before moving to Medellin I did some research on language schools, since one of my main reasons for moving here was to learn Spanish. The one I found the best was [Blink Spanish Immersion](https://blinkspanish.com/). I have a [long history of learning languages](/blog/2024/04/22/my-top-5-techinques-for-how-to-learn-a-language) but I had never done an immersive course before, and I was curious to see how much I could improve in only a few weeks.

## About Blink

Blink is a language school located in El Poblado, the most touristy neighbourhood of Medellín. Since it's an immersive school it offers accommodation and meals in addition to Spanish, but because I already had a place to stay and like to cook my own food I only got the Spanish classes. Blink offers [several different packages](https://blinkspanish.com/stay-and-study/) and I decided to buy three weeks of the BLINK UNLIMITED package.

As you can see there are three different kind of classes: group classes, private classes and master classes.

### Group classes
Group classes are the bulk of the learning. They usually start between 8-9 am and lasts for four hours plus a fifteen minute break. The groups consist of 2-6 students and it's the same group teacher for one week. There are fifteen different difficulty levels and to decide which group you should be in you take a placement test a few days before the first day. The levels are from A1.1 (the lowest) to B2.3 (the highest):

A1.1, A1.2, A1.3, A2.1, A2.2, A2.3, B1.1, B1.2, B1.3, B2.1, B2.2, B2.3.

I got placed in A1.3++/A2.1 for my first week, which is between A1.3 and A2.1.

### Private classes
In a private class it's just you and a teacher. It can be the same teacher as your group teacher or a different one. In my private classes the teacher asked what I wanted to do and sometimes had exercises and games prepared. Apart from some specific questions I mostly just talked with my teacher during the private lessons.

### Master classes
Master classes are different one hour classes focused on one specific topic. The topics range from reflexive verbs, pronunciation, the past tenses, or the subjunctive and there were 35+ weekly master classes to choose from. Importantly, there were the same master classes each week, which is why I switched my master classes to more private classes for my third week.

## The Good
One of the things I liked the most about my time at blink was getting to know the other students and doing activities together. We danced salsa, played tejo, went to a football match, and went to several language exchanges. Most students were in their twenties and from Europe, the United States or Canada. Almost everyone was on a long trip either around the world or through South America. A few people were on a shorter trip to Colombia and maybe some other country. I didn't meet anyone else who was planning to stay longer in Medellín like me.

My favorite teachers were Danny and Daniel Gaitan and for the third week I asked for Danny and managed to get her as my private teacher which was great.


## The Bad
I didn't eat the food or stay at Blink, but I talked to a lot of people who got pretty bored of rice and beans after two weeks. Some people also moved out of the hostel after a few days.


## The Ugly
My last lesson at Blink was a one hour private class with a teacher I hadn't had before. She told me some things that I think it's fair to share.

My level the first week was A1.3++/A2.1, the second week it was A2.2 and the third week it was A2.3. This level of progression is unrealistically fast. The teacher said they do this because students need to feel like they are progressing. To be honest it worked, I did feel happy that I leveled up each week. But the teacher told me that the price of this is that a ton of stuff is skipped on each level. She said to properly learn a level you'd need *several* weeks, not one.


## Conclusion
I am happy with my choice of studying at Blink. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun with the other students. For anyone who is planning to stay for a longer time in Latin America I think it's definitely a great idea. 

I wish I had done two weeks instead of three, because I think it would've been better for me to consolidate all the new information I got during the first two weeks instead of learning more new things.
